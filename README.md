## Moin! I am Jonas and I work on Mixed Reality :man_technologist:

I am a Humanâ€“Computer Interaction Researcher and Augmented & Mixed Reality Developer. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Applied Sciences Niederrhein. Previously, I studied Cognitive Informatics (B.Sc.) and Intelligent Systems (M.Sc.) at Bielefeld University and worked at University of Applied Sciences Emden/Leer during my Ph.D.

My research interests are head-mounted, handheld and projection-based Augmented Reality approaches for training and assistance in work environments, educational settings and to assist cognitively impaired people. In my Ph.D. thesis, I was especially interested in the development and design space of Augmented Reality authoring tools, enabling (non-programmer) domain experts with varying levels of media competency to develop their own Augmented Reality content.

For my work on Augmented Reality interaction concepts and content authoring tools, usability was always a crucial success factor. As I liked the System Usability Scale and deployed it regularly for years, I always wanted to make it more approachable. Therefore, as a side project, the SUS Analysis Toolkit and the SUS PDF Generator are my attempts at aiding my own research goals but also making the SUS (and the vast amounts of consequent literature and insights on it) more accessible and approachable to others.

As I am an open science and open source advocate, I am trying to share as much as possible here.
