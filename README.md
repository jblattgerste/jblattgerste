## Moin! I am Jonas and i work on Augmented Reality :man_technologist:

I am a Humanâ€“Computer Interaction Researcher and Augmented & Mixed Reality Developer. Currently, i am a Research Associate and Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Applied Sciences Emden/Leer. Previously, i studied Cognitive Informatics (B.Sc.) and Intelligent Systems (M.Sc.) at Bielefeld University.

My research interests are head-mounted, handheld and projection-based Augmented Reality approaches for training and assistance in work environments, educational settings and to assist cognitively impaired people. I am a responsible investigator in the Heb@AR project (Handheld Augmented Reality in academic midwifery education), where me and my team develop handheld Augmented Reality training scenarios for medical emergency situations in the academic midwifery education context.

In my Ph.D. thesis, i am especially interested in the development and design space of Augmented Reality authoring tools, enabling (non-programmer) domain experts with varying levels of media competency to develop their own Augmented Reality training scenarios.

As i am an open science and open source advocate, i am trying to share as much as possible here.
